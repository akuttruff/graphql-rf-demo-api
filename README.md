### Sample GraphQL service for Renew Financial tech talk.

This talk and the following code samples borrow heavily from [Eve Porcello](https://github.com/eveporcello)'s GraphQL Workshop. I have rebuilt the schema using types and queries relevant to my work at Renew Financial, where we build software to help make clean energy financing available to homeowners. 

#### Steps
1. [Define our contractor and product type types and add our first query](https://github.com/akuttruff/graphql-rf-demo-api/tree/create-initial-types-and-queries)
1. [Create a mutation to add a new contractor or product type](https://github.com/akuttruff/graphql-rf-demo-api/tree/add-mutations)
